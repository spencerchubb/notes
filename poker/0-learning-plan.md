Here's a focused plan to get better at Texas Hold'em, leveraging my math and tech background.

### **1. Master the Basics First (1–2 weeks)**

* **Learn hand rankings cold.**
* **Understand position:** Play tighter in early positions, looser in late.
* **Start with a solid preflop range chart.** Use one from Upswing or Jonathan Little.

### **2. Leverage Your Math Edge**

* **Pot odds and equity:** Learn how to calculate quickly.
* **Expected value (EV):** Understand +EV decisions vs. -EV. This is key to long-term success.
* **Combinatorics:** Useful for reading ranges (how many combos of hands beat you, etc.).

### **3. Use Software Tools**

* **Equilab** – Free tool for equity calculations and range analysis.
* **Flopzilla** – Powerful tool for studying board textures and how ranges hit.
* **GTO+ or PioSOLVER (advanced)** – To explore optimal play. Start basic, but you're capable of going deep here.

### **4. Practice Online (Microstakes or Play Money)**

* Aim to get volume in. Review hands post-session.
* Sites: PokerStars, ACR, or even mobile apps for practice.
* Track your results and mistakes.

### **5. Learn from Good Content**

* **YouTube channels:**

  * *Jonathan Little*, *The Poker Bank*, *Red Chip Poker*
* **Books:**

  * *"The Course"* by Ed Miller (great for live low-stakes)
  * *"Modern Poker Theory"* by Michael Acevedo (for deep GTO/mathematical play)

### **6. Build a Study Habit**

* 1 hour play = 30 min review.
* Review marked hands, ask: *“Was this +EV? What does my opponent’s range look like?”*
* Reddit r/poker, Discord groups, or forums like TwoPlusTwo can help.

### **7. Focus Areas for You (as a beginner with math/tech background):**

* **Preflop ranges** – Learn default charts.
* **Bet sizing theory** – Understand when and why to bet small vs. big.
* **Range vs. hand thinking** – Always think in ranges, not specific hands.
