## Poker hands from strongest to weakest

**Royal Flush**: Five card sequence from 10 to the Ace in the same suit (10,J,Q,K,A).

**Straight Flush**: Any five card sequence in the same suit. (eg. 8,9,10,J,Q and A,2,3,4,5 of same suit). All the cards are of the same suit, and all are consecutive. Ranking between straights is determined by the value of the high end of the straight.

**4 of a kind / Quads**: All four cards of the same index (eg. J,J,J,J).

**Full House**: Three of a kind combined with a pair (eg. A,A,A,5,5). Ties on a full house are broken by the three of a kind, as you cannot have two equal sets of three of a kind in any single deck.

**Flush**: Any five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence. Don't be tricked into thinking that all five cards are the same color. The high card determines the winner if two or more people have a flush.

**Straight**: Five cards in sequence, but not in the same suit. A straight cannot wrap, meaning it is not a straight if you have a Queen, King, Ace, Two, Three. The higher straight wins if two or more people have a straight. In case of straights that tie, the pot is split.

**Three of a kind**: Three cards of the same value. The highest set of three cards wins.

**Two pair**: Two separate pairs (eg. 4,4,Q,Q). As usual the pair with the higher value is used to determine the winner of a tie.

**Pair**: One pair of two equal value cards constitutes a pair.

**High Card**: If no one has any of the above winning hands, the tie is determined by the highest value card in the hand. If the highest cards are a tie then the tie is broken by the second highest card. Suits are not used to break ties.

## Tight vs Loose

**Tight**: Being selective about which hands you play, like only playing when you have really good cards. Think of it like being picky about which opportunities you take.

**Loose**: Playing many different hands, even with mediocre cards. It's like being willing to try lots of different opportunities.

When to be tight (play fewer hands):

- When you have great cards that are likely to win
- When you're in a good position at the table (one of the last to act)
- When you're trying to complete a strong hand (like needing one more card for a straight or flush)

When to be loose (play more hands):

- When you're one of the first to act at the table
- When you're in a bad position (one of the first to act)

## Why playing with fake money is bad for learning

1. **No real stakes = bad habits**: Players don't care about losing fake chips, so they make irrational, reckless plays they'd never make with real money.

2. **Poor competition**: Most fake money games are filled with inexperienced or unserious players, so you don't face realistic opposition.

3. **Wrong incentives**: Bluffing, pot odds, bankroll management, and discipline don't matter when there's nothing on the line.

4. **False confidence**: Success in fake money games doesn't translate to real-money skill, leading to overconfidence and losses later.
