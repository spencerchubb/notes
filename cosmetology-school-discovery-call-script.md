## Handling Common Objections

**If they say: "We don't have the capacity for more students"**
"I understand that concern. Could you help me understand what specifically would need to change to accommodate more students? Is it space, instructors, or something else? What's the cost of not being able to take on more students?"

**If they say: "We've never worked with a high school before"**
"That's actually why this could be such a great opportunity. We handle all the regular high school requirements, and you just focus on what you do best - teaching cosmetology.

**If they say: "We need to think about it"**
"I understand. What specific information would help you make this decision? Would it be helpful to see some data on our academic results or talk to another partner school? What's the cost of delaying this decision?"
