Toured Ann Webb Skin Institute. Not interested in general marketing help, because marketing agencies pitch them all the time. They are SUPER interested in bringing in high schoolers, nobody has pitched them that before. Her face lit up when I mentioned in can be their branding, e.g. Ann Webb High School. She seemed confused about how exactly the program would work.

Talked with Asher about pivoting from him working on Luma to doing dev for gamification service. He just wants to be individudal contributor engineer, not do anything else. Talked with Eli about Luma priorities, I will brainlift on accreditation, he will brainlift on student recruitment.
