Went to Alpha School to help with setting up MentorPi workshop and get kids set up with Cursor and Python. Learned that Ashley used to work in L1 and now she is opening up Valenta Academy. She hopes that the charter application doesn't go through because she doesn't want to be subject to more state regulations.

Had lunch with Jennifer Painter. Could be good connection but not sure how yet.
