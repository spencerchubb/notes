I set up a meeting with Ashanti Sears. She works for EdChoice and is interested in transparency and accountability in alternative schools. In that meeting I want to talk to her about the learning progress dashboard idea Joe talked about. I need to figure out who is interested in working on that project so I can loop them into the meeting.

Signed up for a chess club event on May 9th with the Austin travel chess club. Need to convince Abraham to go. At that meeting, pitch people on a chess microschool.
