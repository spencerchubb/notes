Met with ~15 superbuilders who are adding gamification features to their apps. We're going to build a gamification service to be used by all apps. This will help solve the motivation problem. For example, do a lesson in Alpha Learn to get XP, then buy a skin in a video game.

Started designing the database schema and API schema for the gamification service.
