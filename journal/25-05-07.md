Met with Stef Baduria, learned about how Alpha School works for younger kids. Currently have gaps in software where guides have to help with academics. Met Emma who's interested in us building something for her (not sure what her last name is).

Looked at Stef's wishlist of apps and intro'd David who's working on feedback platform and AJ who's working with me on gamification service.
