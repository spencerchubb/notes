## Alpha School Cold Call Script

### Intro
"Hi, this is Spencer from Alpha School. I'm calling about a partnership that could bring more students into your program. Do you have a minute to chat or do you know who I should speak with about partnerships?"

### Handling Gatekeepers/Receptionists
"Hi, this is Spencer from Alpha School. I'm calling about a partnership that could bring more students into your program. Who would be the best person to speak with about educational partnerships?"

**If they ask for more details:**
"I'd be happy to explain, but I'd really like to make sure I'm speaking with the right person first. Who typically handles decisions about program partnerships and curriculum development?"

**If they ask you to leave a message:**
"Thank you, but I'd prefer to speak directly with the decision maker. Could you tell me who that would be and when might be a good time to reach them?"

**If they say they can't connect you:**
"I understand. Could you help me with two things? First, who would be the right person to speak with about this? And second, what's the best way to reach them - email, direct line, or should I try calling at a specific time?"

### Main Pitch
"So here's the idea - we run a highschool here in Austin. Our students knock out all their academics in about 2 hours each morning, and they learn *double* as much as traditional schools. That leaves them with most of the day for real-world skills and things they're passionate about.

What I'm thinking is - what if we partnered with each other to do a cosmetology program for highschoolers. We handle the regular high school stuff, and you just keep doing what you're best at with cosmetology. By the time they finish high school, they can be partially or maybe even fully certified.

You get more students in the door, and these kids get a head start on their careers. Plus, you'd have a pipeline of students who might continue with your advanced programs after graduation."

### If you have to leave a voicemail

"Hi, this is Spencer from Alpha School. I'm calling about a partnership that could bring more students into your program.

Here's what I'm thinking - We run a highschool here in Austin. The kids crush their academics in 2 hours a day. Since academics only take 2 hours, that leaves the rest of the day for a real-world skill like cosmetology. We would take care of the regular high school stuff, and you keep doing what you're best at with cosmetology. This partnership could get more students in your program, and give them a head start on their careers.

I'd love to chat this week about how it could actually work for your program. My name is Spencer Chubb, and you can reach me at 309 532 7080. Thank you!"

### Handling Questions

**If they ask: "How do kids possibly learn everything in just 2 hours?"**
"Yeah, I get that question a lot. It sounds crazy until you see it work. We cut out all the wasted time in normal schools - no busy work, no behavior issues, no waiting for 30 kids to all get on the same page. Our students focus on actually mastering the material, not just sitting in a desk for hours. The results speak for themselves - our classes all get top 1% on standardized tests."

**If they ask: "We've never done anything like this before."**
"That's true, most schools haven't, and that's why this such an opportunity. We handle all the regular high school stuff, and you just keep doing what you're already great at - teaching cosmetology. We could start small with just a few students to see how it goes."

### Wrap-Up
"I'd love to grab 20 minutes this week to talk through how this might actually work for your school. How's your schedule looking? I can also send over some info about what we've been doing and the results we're seeing with our current students."

### After Call
"Thanks for chatting. I'll shoot you an email with some basics about our school and what we've accomplished so far. Looking forward to talking more on [day] and figuring out if this makes sense for both of us."

Subject:
Partnership with Alpha School

Hi <name>,

Want to bring more students into your program? We run a highschool in Austin and other locations (Alpha School). Our students knock out their academics in about 2 hours each morning, and they learn *double* as much as traditional schools. That leaves them with most of the day for real-world skills like cosmetology.

What if we partnered with each other to do a cosmetology program for highschoolers? We handle the regular high school stuff, and you keep doing what you're best at with cosmetology. You get more students in the door, and these kids get a head start on their careers. Plus, you'd have a pipeline of students who might continue with your advanced programs after graduation.

I'd love to send more info and chat for 20 minutes sometime this week about how this could actually work for your program.

Best,
Spencer Chubb
